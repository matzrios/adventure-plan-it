# Project Title
Adventure Plan-It

## Overview

Adventure Plan-It is a place for people who want to start their vacations or in this scenario their adventure with their wanted activities.

### Problem

I have noticed that most travel planners always start with the locations and planning with that in mind. Why not start the travel plan with the activities instead and have options of destinations based on the chosen activities?

### Features
